7. Variable associated methods
   1. Inilization method -> It is used in program
                         -> It is static method
                         -> It is a time consuming 
                         -> var=10
                         -> Name,DOB,PAN
   2. On line method     -> It is mentationed while 
                         -> executiong the program
                         -> It is dynamic
                         -> Its reads data from keyboard       
                         -> raw_input() ,it accept all data types
                         -> int,float,char,string,complex
                         ->Exp,sal                     
8. Variable accessing methods
   1.Direct method  : print "Message:",(var1,var2,var3)
   2.C based method : Similar to c type syntax
                      print "Message :%d%s%f " % (var)
9. Multiple variables are inilized at a time
   a=b=c=d=10
10. Multiple variables are inilized at a time with 
   different values
   a,b,c,d=10,20,30,40 
   a=10 ,b=20 , c=30 ,d=40
